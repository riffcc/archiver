# Documentation Requirements

## Public API Documentation

All public items must have doc comments covering:
- Purpose: What the item does
- Parameters: Descriptions of all parameters 
- Returns: What is returned and under what conditions
- Panics: When the function might panic
- Safety: Safety considerations for unsafe code
- Errors: Possible error conditions
- Examples: Usage examples that demonstrate functionality

## Change Documentation

When modifying code, document:
- Errors being addressed
- Changes made
- Rationale for changes
- Performance implications
- Safety implications

## Inline Comments

- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Use the format: `// {explanation}`
- Focus on why, not what (the code shows what)
- Make comments accurate and keep them updated
